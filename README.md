## About 
BadBoy the Ultimate Raider
Created By: CodeMyLife and CuteOne

-- Intro --
BadBoy was developed from the ground up by CodeMyLife and CuteOne with additonal contributions from other developers who worked on combat rotation bots such as PQR, ProbablyEngine, and others. 
While it is more of a developer playground as compared to the more "for profit" bots this is free to use and we feel it is just as good, if not better, than the bots you pay money for. 
Dont agree? Feel free to post any issues you have and we will do our best to resolve them. **Please note that FireHack is required to use this.

-- Features --
- Object Manager
- Ground Spells Support 
- Healing Engine
- Clean User Interface w/ Profile Specific Toggle Buttons and Bot/Profile Specific Options
- Debug Frame
- And much more as new features and improvements are constantly added.

-- Special Thanks by CodeMyLife --
I wanted to thanks these people that previously collaborated with me on other projects that teached me their knowledge. 
This is really important to me to thank these peoples. I would not have released this without their support.
- lol1DK: For the best Lua Unlocker/Hack ever.
- Bgreen12: For teaching me how to make a standalone addon for FireHack and How to use FH Objects Manager. Huge tanks goes to you mate.
- Diesal: Ideas on how should look a nice UI and how it works.
- Bubba & CrystalTech: The healing engine and so many exemples of great lua codes.
- CuteOne: For your support of my efforts. For doing this all with me.

-- Profile Sellers/Stealers --
